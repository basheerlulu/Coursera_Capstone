We want to explore how much they are similar or dissimilar in aspects from a tourist point of view regarding food, accommodation, beautiful places, and many more.\n\nToday Tourism is one of the pillars of the economy and the people most often visits those countries who are rich in heritage and developed enough from a foreign prospective, like friendly environment. Every city is unique in their own way and give something new. And now the information is so common regarding location of every place around the world on your fingertips which make it easier to explore. Therefore, tourists always eager to travel to different places on the basis of available information, and the comparison (the part of the information) between the two cities always assist to choose the specific places or according to their choice."
